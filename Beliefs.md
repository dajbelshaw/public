# My beliefs

- We do not have privileged access to our own mental or physical states.
- Consciousness is an illusion.
- We can never really know whether God exists.
- Human beings are neither fundamentally good nor fundamentally evil as both terms are constructs (and therefore in flux)
- Pragmatism is a useful way of orienting oneself to the external world.
