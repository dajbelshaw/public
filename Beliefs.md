# My beliefs

- We do not have privileged access to our own mental or physical states.
- Consciousness is an illusion.
- We can never really know whether God exists.
- Human beings are neither fundamentally good nor fundamentally evil as both terms are constructs (and therefore in flux)
- Pragmatism is a useful way of orienting oneself to the external world.
- Society creates crimes for 'criminals' to commit, but this does not always absolve the individual from blame.
- Some things are 'absolutely' (morally) wrong because they are do not promote the harmony of the community, nation or entire human race.
